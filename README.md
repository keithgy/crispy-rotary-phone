# Grocery Inventory & Sales Analytics Project

This project seeks to explore and enhance personal data analysis developments mainly focused on SQL, Excel, and Power BI on a retail grocery dataset.

## Tools Used
**Excel Power Query for data cleaning, data transformation & pivot analysis**
  - Built calculated fields to generate recommended reorder levels based on inventory performance
  - Performed percentage sales calculations to support ABC classification logic
  - Applied Power Query to clean and reshape the raw CSV data for consistency and analysis readiness
**MySQL for transformative data analytics**
  - Normalized raw data into four modular tables for efficient querying
  - Enabled advanced inventory and sales analytics and performed ABC Classification through SQL queries
**Power BI for interactive dashboards**
  - Improved trend visibility and comparative analysis across multiple performance segments
  - Interactive dashboard displaying key metrics

## Key Insights
- Visualized category-wise monthly sales trends
- Reactive ABC Inventory Prioritisation
- View best & worst performing products based on KPI for better-informed deicision making
- Recommend products for discontinuation based on ABC clasification and KPI metrics

## Files Included
- `sql_queries/`: SQL scripts used for transformation and insights
- `excel_data/`: Workbook with pivot tables and reorder calculator
